    <h2>Assignment questions and answers</h2>
    <p>
      What is the difference between normal html elements and semantics html
      elements?
    </p>
    <p>
      Normal HTML elements, such as <em> div, span, p,</em> etc., are generic
      elements that have no inherent semantic meaning. They are primarily used
      for layout and organizing content on a web page. These elements do not
      provide any specific information about the type or purpose of the content
      they contain. While Semantic elements, such as section, article, header,
      footer, etc.., are HTML elements that carry a semantic meaning and provide
      contextual information about the structure and purpose of the content they
      enclose. These elements are designed to improve accessibility, search
      engine optimization (SEO), and facilitate the understanding of web
      documents by both humans and machines.
    </p>
    <p>What is the disparity between closing tags and self-closing tag?</p>
    <p>
      Closing tags are used for HTML elements that have both an opening tag and
      a corresponding closing tag. The opening tag is represented by the element
      name enclosed in angle brackets, and the closing tag is represented by the
      same element name preceded by a forward slash. While Self-closing tags are
      used for HTML elements that do not have any content or do not require a
      closing tag. Instead of using a separate closing tag, self-closing tags
      combine the opening and closing tag into a single tag by adding a forward
      slash before the closing angle bracket
    </p>
    <p>what distinguishes inline elements from block elements in html?</p>
    <p>
      Block elements start on a new line, occupy the full width available, and
      create block-level boxes, while inline elements do not start on new lines,
      occupy only necessary space, and flow within the text or other inline
      elements
